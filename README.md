AgriImpactBot
Environmental Impact Assessor for Energy-Based Farming Setups
AgriImpactBot is an AI-powered chatbot built to assist farmers, students, and researchers in evaluating the environmental impact of different energy sources used in agricultural operations.

This web-based chatbot uses a Large Language Model (LLM) API to provide intelligent, real-time assessments and suggestions to promote sustainable energy usage in farming.

What It Does
Evaluates the environmental footprint (carbon emissions, sustainability, energy efficiency) of different farming energy setups.

Accepts natural language queries like:
"I use a diesel pump for 4 hours daily on 2 acres"

Generates a summary report on the environmental impact of the given energy usage.

Provides LLM-generated suggestions for greener alternatives such as solar, biogas, or hybrid models.

Key Features
Web-based chatbot interface built with Python

LLM API integration for environmental reasoning

Custom environmental impact reports

Intelligent follow-up suggestions based on input

Modular design for easy future expansion

Tech Stack
Python (Flask / Streamlit / Gradio – based on final implementation)

HTML/CSS for frontend

LLM API (e.g., OpenAI) for natural language understanding

Optional JavaScript for UI enhancements

Future Scope
Real-time location-based emission data integration

Multilingual support for regional accessibility

Integration with weather or energy pricing APIs

Scalable to cover non-agricultural rural energy use cases

Why This Project Matters
Agriculture is a major consumer of energy and contributor to environmental change. AgriImpactBot uses AI to help users assess and reduce their environmental footprint, bringing sustainability insights directly into their hands—accessible, practical, and relevant to Indian farming realities.
